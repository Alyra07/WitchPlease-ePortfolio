							<p>Witch, Please! is a <strong>shop simulation game</strong> set in a magical fantasy world. Players take on the role of a quirky young witch who recently opened her own enchantment workshop. Curious creatures visit the shop with unusual requests, from enchanted swords to cursed dolls.
							The core gameplay revolves around interacting with customers, enchanting their items based on their personalities and stories, and navigating light puzzle challenges on the enchanting workbench. The game blends storytelling, and fantasy-themed enchanting mechanics in a cozy shop atmosphere.</p>

							<p>There will be three scenes in the game: the Main Menu, the Customer Window where dialogue and item retrieval take place, and the Workbench where the enchantment minigames occur. The following mockups illustrate the design and layout of each scene (click an image to enlarge):</p>

							<h3 class="sub">Story Outline</h3>

							<p>The game will have four different customer characters, each with their own unique archetype and storyline:</p>

							<h4>Wolf</h4>
							<p>A gruff, battle-worn warrior who barges into the shop with his dented sword. He demands the witch to reapply enchantments and clean the weapon. His tone is dismissive and arrogant, openly mocking the humble shop. He's a tough customer, expecting everything to be perfect without any patience or courtesy.</p>

							<h4>Raccoon</h4>
							<p>A curious and eccentric creature who stumbles upon the shop by accident. Enthusiastic about magic, he presents his personal pouch â€” claiming it holds his most valuable treasures. He insists the witch enchants it to make it forever secure but strictly warns her not to look inside. He speaks in fast, chaotic sentences, radiating chaotic energy.</p>

							<h4>Bird</h4>
							<p>A shy and gentle artist who heard about the shop from the talkative raccoon. The bird carries a single feather, which he hopes to have enchanted for his next art piece. Nervous and easily flustered, he struggles to articulate his request but is polite and kind-hearted.</p>

							<h4>Cat</h4>
							<p>A cunning and manipulative character. She arrives with a small voodoo doll, asking the witch to enchant it. Unknown to the witch at first, the cat plans to use the doll to control the witch herself. However, the wolf unexpectedly returns to the shop to intervene, creating a twist in the story.</p>

								<h2>System Design</h2>
							</header>

							<h4>Main Menu Scene</h4>
							<p>In the Main Menu, players can start the game (leads to Customer Window Scene) or exit. The scene will include a background image, the title, and buttons for game interactions, and adjusting settings (e.g. volume).</p>

							<h4>Customer Window Scene</h4>
							<p>In the Customer Window, players will interact with customers who arrive at the shop. Each customer has a unique item and story. Players can click on the item to retrieve it and start the enchanting process on the Workbench. Characters will arrive in a specific order, and players must complete their requests to return the item and move on to the next customer.</p>

							<h4>Workbench Scene</h4>
							<p>In the Workbench scene, players will perform enchanting minigames using various tools. Each tool has its own unique mechanics, such as dragging, clicking, or following patterns. Successfully enchanting the item will return the player to the Customer Window.</p>

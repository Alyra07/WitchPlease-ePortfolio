				<p>There will be three scenes in the game: the Main Menu, the Customer Window where dialogue and item
					retrieval take place, and the Workbench where the enchantment minigames occur. The following mockups

				<h3 class="sub">Story Outline</h3>

				<p>The player takes on the role of a silent witch who runs a small enchantment shop tucked away in a mysterious corner of the world. Throughout the game, <strong>four distinct characters</strong> visit the shop, each with a unique personality, magical request, and deeper motivations that slowly come to light. The gameplay revolves around interacting with these customers, enchanting their objects, and uncovering the threads that link their stories together. Though the witch never speaks, the world and its characters grow through these quiet encounters, building toward an unexpected climax.</p>

				<h4>Daran - The Wolf</h4>
				<p>Daran is a stoic, battle-hardened warrior. Cold, proud, and distant, he approaches the shop with a practical goal: to have his sword cleaned and re-enchanted. He treats the witch's shop as little more than a tool to serve his needs and barely acknowledges the witch beyond what's necessary. However, his return at the story's end reveals a deeper layer. Daran is not just a lone fighter - he's a protector, someone who's been watching from a distance. When danger arises from another customer's darker intentions, he steps back into the shop to intervene.</p>

				<h4>Finn - The Raccoon</h4>
				<p>Finn is an eccentric and curious traveler who stumbles into the shop entirely by accident. His energy is chaotic, his thoughts scattered, and his presence unpredictable. Despite his odd behavior, there's sincerity beneath the messiness. He brings a pouch for enchantment, claiming it holds his most important belongings - but it's clear there's something more personal and emotional attached to it. Finn's nervous energy masks a desire to protect something precious and private, hinting at vulnerability under his erratic charm.</p>

				<h4>Cael - The Bird</h4>
				<p>Cael is a quiet and thoughtful soul. Soft-spoken and hesitant, he visits the shop after hearing about it through Finn, though the two aren't close. Cael carries a single feather, a delicate object tied to a memory or a person from his past. He seeks enchantment not for protection or power, but for emotional closure. His request is tied to a piece of art he's trying to completeâ€”perhaps a poem, perhaps a farewell. His interaction with the witch is subtle but profound, reflecting a need to make peace with something unspoken.</p>

				<h4>Tara - The Cat</h4>
				<p>Tara is the final visitor, and the most dangerous. She arrives with charm and grace, cloaking her true intentions beneath a veil of flirtation and flattery. Her request - a simple enchantment on a doll - seems harmless at first. But it soon becomes clear that the doll is a vessel for a much darker spell, one designed to control or steal the witch's power. Tara's manipulation is clever and masked by charisma, but her plan is interrupted just in time by Daran, revealing a larger conflict at play.</p>

					<h2>System Design</h2>
				</header>

				<h4>Main Menu Scene</h4>
				<p>In the Main Menu, players can start the game (leads to Customer Window Scene) or exit. The scene will
					include a background image, the title, and buttons for game interactions, and adjusting settings
					(e.g. volume).</p>

				<h4>Customer Window Scene</h4>
				<p>In the Customer Window, players will interact with customers who arrive at the shop. Each customer
					has a unique item and story. Players can click on the item to retrieve it and start the enchanting
					process on the Workbench. Characters will arrive in a specific order, and players must complete
					their requests to return the item and move on to the next customer.</p>

				<h4>Workbench Scene</h4>
				<p>In the Workbench scene, players will perform enchanting minigames using various tools. Each tool has
					its own unique mechanics, such as dragging, clicking, or following patterns. Successfully enchanting
					the item will return the player to the Customer Window.</p>
